# How to install plugins

After installing the plugins you wanted from the [plugin list](/plugins/index.md), open the file manager of your choice and move the plugins from your **Download** folder to **Aliucord/Plugins** folder. 

# How to install themes

First, you need to install [**Themer**](/themes/index.md) plugin, then you can download the themes you want from the [theme list](/themes/index.md). Installing the themes are same as installing plugins, but this time put the themes you downloaded to your **Aliucord/Themes** folder.
